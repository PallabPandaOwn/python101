Let's return to the music example. Let's take an example,we're going to say "Genre", "Artist" and "Year". Create a new Python file and create 3 functions with the same name as those attributes. So in this example we'd have one function named "genre" another named "artist" and another called "year".

When someone calls any of those functions, that function should return the corresponding value for that attribute. For example, if we call the "Artist" function our function would return "Dave Brubeck". Yours should return whatever values make sense for your music choice.
